      "sub1": {
        "title": "1.1. Implant Mimics Real \"Tooth Root\"",
        "desc": "Dental Implant (or <strong>implant placement</strong>) is a method of restoring missing teeth by placing a biological post (implant) into the jawbone, replacing the lost tooth root. This post will integrate with the bone, creating a solid foundation for a new tooth, helping you regain a strong, natural, and long-lasting set of teeth."
      },
      "sub2": {
        "title": "1.2. How is Implant Different from Dental Bridge and Removable Dentures?",
        "desc": "Unlike dental bridges (which require grinding 2 adjacent teeth) and removable dentures (often loose and uncomfortable), <strong>implant placement</strong> is an independent solution that does not affect adjacent teeth and prevents jawbone loss. This is the optimal method for restoring missing teeth."
      },
      "sub3": {
        "title": "1.3. When Should You Consider Dental Implant Placement?",
        "desc": "You should consider dental implant placement when: missing one or multiple teeth, missing full arch teeth, or having mild to moderate bone loss. Even when the jawbone has significantly resorbed, you can still have <strong>implant placement</strong> combined with bone grafting or sinus lift."

      "title": "2. Dental Implant Placement Procedure",
      "sub1": {
        "title": "2.1. Diagnosis with CT Cone Beam and Treatment Planning",
        "desc": "The first step is taking a 3D CT Cone Beam scan to assess bone volume, nerve positions, and sinuses. Then, the doctor will create a virtual treatment plan, determining the position, size, and number of implant posts needed, ensuring safety and effectiveness. Clear planning helps patients understand the procedure and expected results."
      },
      "sub2": {
        "title": "2.2. Gentle Implant Placement, Reasonable Pain Management",
        "desc": "The surgical procedure is performed under local anesthesia, quickly and gently. After surgery, you may experience mild pain in the first few days, which is a normal reaction. During the bone integration period, you may be fitted with temporary teeth to ensure aesthetics and function."
      },
      "sub3": {
        "title": "2.3. Osseointegration and Completion of Porcelain Restoration",
        "desc": "Common integration time ranges from a few weeks to a few months, depending on the individual's body and implant type. Once the implant is stable, the dentist takes impressions and attaches the porcelain crown with appropriate color and shape. The final result is a new, strong tooth that allows comfortable chewing and natural aesthetics."
