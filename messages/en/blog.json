      "title": "1. What are Dental Implants and why choose implant treatment in Da Nang?",
      "sub1": {
        "title": "1.1. Implants replicate natural tooth roots",
        "desc": "A dental implant is a biocompatible post placed into the jawbone to replace a missing tooth root. Once the implant integrates with the bone, the dentist attaches an abutment and a dental crown, creating a strong new tooth with natural chewing function and harmonious aesthetics. With <strong>dental implant placement</strong>, you gain a long-term foundation rather than a temporary solution."
      },
      "sub2": {
        "title": "1.2. How are implants different from bridges and removable dentures?",
        "desc": "Dental bridges require grinding down adjacent teeth, while removable dentures are often loose and provide weak chewing force. Implants stand independently, do not affect natural teeth, and help prevent long-term bone loss. Therefore, choosing <strong>dental implants</strong> means opting for an optimal solution in both function and longevity."
      },
      "sub3": {
        "title": "1.3. When should you consider Dental Implants?",
        "desc": "Many patients seek dental implants due to single tooth loss, multiple missing teeth, or mild to moderate bone loss. These cases can often be treated after CT scanning and proper planning. Even patients requiring bone grafting or sinus lifting may still be candidates if evaluated accurately and treated with appropriate techniques."

      "title": "2. Dental Implant procedure",
      "sub1": {
        "title": "2.1. Diagnosis with Cone Beam CT and treatment planning",
        "desc": "The dental implant process in Da Nang begins with CT imaging to assess bone volume, nerve position, and sinus anatomy. Based on this data, the dentist simulates implant placement direction, size, and safety margins, while anticipating the need for bone grafting if required. A clear treatment plan helps patients understand and manage expectations from the start."
      },
      "sub2": {
        "title": "2.2. Gentle implant placement with effective pain control",
        "desc": "On the day of surgery, the implant site is locally anesthetized; most procedures are completed quickly and smoothly. Mild swelling or tightness in the first few days is normal and subsides with proper care. In some cases, temporary teeth can be placed to maintain comfort and function during the osseointegration phase."
      },
      "sub3": {
        "title": "2.3. Osseointegration and final crown restoration",
        "desc": "The osseointegration period typically ranges from several weeks to a few months, depending on individual healing and implant type. Once the implant is stable, the dentist takes impressions and places a crown with appropriate color and shape. The final result is a strong, functional tooth with natural aesthetics."

      "sub1": {
        "title": "3.1. Factors that determine the cost",
        "desc": "<strong>Dental implant costs in Da Nang</strong> depend on implant brand (Korean, German, Swiss…), surface technology, bone grafting or sinus lift requirements, crown material (zirconia, glass ceramic), number of implants, and treatment complexity. In addition, sterilization protocols, surgical guides, time, and professional expertise all contribute to the final cost."
      },
      "sub2": {
        "title": "3.2. Transparent and upfront pricing is essential",
        "desc": "When comparing <strong>dental implant costs in Da Nang</strong>, ensure the quoted price includes imaging, follow-up visits, manufacturer warranties, and clinic guarantees. Costs should be agreed upon from the beginning to avoid unexpected charges. At Passion Dental Da Nang, we are committed to full price transparency before, during, and after treatment, delivering the best value and experience for our patients."

      "sub3": {
        "title": "3.3. Phased financial planning",
        "desc": "Many <strong>dental implant clinics in Da Nang</strong> offer installment plans or phased payments: a deposit at implant placement, payment at abutment placement, and final payment when the crown is installed. This staged approach helps optimize cash flow while maintaining high-quality care."
